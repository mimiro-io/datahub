## Code of Conduct

If you haven't already, please read our [code of conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) to ensure all changes go through pull requests and are reviewed by the maintainers.

Please use the following steps:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Contribution License
When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github Issues
We use GitHub [issues](https://github.com/mimiro-io/datahub/issues) to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue, but please check to see if this issue has already been reported.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code and data if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or things you tried that didn't work)
